Spring Pet Clinic is a classic reference application used to demonstrate best practices. The Pet Clinic application actually has it's origin within the J2EE/JEE community.

The Spring Framework team took the original Pet Clinic application and rebuilt it using Spring, to demonstrate best practices.

This project is the result of the implementation of the different assignments during the course of "Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru" by John Thompson.
